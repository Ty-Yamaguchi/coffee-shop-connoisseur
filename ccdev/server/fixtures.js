Still good coffee – not quite the same atmosphere.  We recommend getting the coffee and walking across the street and drinking it at the beach ',

The atmosphere is classy and the service is relaxed, which is another way to say that you shouldn’t go there if you’re in a hurry. Grab a seat, relax, and enjoy the food prepared and drinks concocted by Markus and Jana, the culinary masterminds who own the place.',
